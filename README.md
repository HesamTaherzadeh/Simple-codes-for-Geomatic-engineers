# Simple-codes-for-Geomatic-engineers
Here some files will be found that have been coded mostly in python using various libraries, to compute some basic operations aimed for Geomatic engineers

> ***First app***: ***Program to compute first fundamental coeffs (Differential geometry)***
> brief explantion:
> in this code written as a python newbie, i computed the *first and second fundemental coefficients*, *main curvature* and *gaussian curvature*
> This code is implemented in python, with the help of sympy module.
